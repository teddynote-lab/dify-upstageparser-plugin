Last Updated: March 15, 2025

## Overview

The Upstage Document Parse Plugin ("Plugin") is designed to help users convert various document formats into structured content using the Upstage Document Parse API. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our Plugin.

## Information Collection

### User-Provided Information

- **API Credentials**: Your Upstage API key that you provide for authentication purposes.
- **Document Data**: The content of documents that you submit for processing.

### Automatically Collected Information

- **Usage Data**: Information about how you use the Plugin, including which features you access and the frequency of use.
- **Performance Data**: Technical information related to the Plugin's performance and any errors that may occur.
- **Cache Data**: Hash values of processed documents and their results to optimize performance and reduce redundant processing.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

## Data Storage and Processing

### Local Storage

- **Document Cache**: The Plugin stores hashes of processed documents and their results locally to optimize performance. This cache expires after a set period (default: 1 hour).
- **Temporary Files**: During processing, temporary files may be created on your system. These are automatically cleaned up upon completion unless debug mode is enabled.
- **Output Files**: Processed document results are stored in the configured output directory.

### Cloud Processing
