# Contributing Guidelines

## Multilingual Documentation

This project maintains documentation in multiple languages to serve our global user base. Currently, we support:

- English (README.md) - primary/source documentation
- Korean (README_KO.md)

### Guidelines for Documentation Changes

When making changes to documentation:

1. **Synchronize Changes**: If you update content in one language, please make corresponding updates to other language versions as well.

2. **Language Badges**: Make sure the language selector badges remain at the top of each README file.

3. **Content Structure**: Keep the same section structure across all language versions to make maintenance easier.

4. **Adding New Languages**: If you want to add support for a new language:
   - Create a new file named `README_XX.md` where XX is the language code
   - Add language selector badges to all README files
   - Update the GitHub workflow to include the new language file

5. **Translation Review**: When contributing translations, please ensure they are accurate and maintain the technical meaning of the original content.

## GitHub Workflow

We have a GitHub workflow that will automatically check if changes to one README file have corresponding updates in other language versions. This helps maintain consistency across documentation.
